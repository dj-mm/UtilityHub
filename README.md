UtilityHub ✨ is a fast and privacy-friendly collection of useful web tools combined into a single index.html file. It runs directly inside the browser and requires no backend, making it easy to deploy on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting platform.

UtilityHub includes powerful text tools ✍️ such as case conversion, word and character counting, removing extra spaces, reversing text, and copying content. It also provides a QR code generator 🔳, a URL shortener ✂️ that first tries TinyURL and falls back to a device-local short link when needed, and an image resizer 🖼️ that supports resizing and optional target-size compression in kilobytes.

All processing happens inside the browser for speed and privacy. The interface is built with Tailwind CSS and the functionalities are implemented using lightweight JavaScript.

Main Features:
• Text utilities: UPPER, lower, Title Case, remove spaces, reverse text, copy, live counters
• QR code generation 🔳
• URL shortener ✂️ with TinyURL support and local fallback
• Image resizer and compressor 🖼️ with optional target KB output
• Optional Add to Home Screen support when PWA files are added
• Simple single-file project for easy deployment 🚀

How to Use:
Download or clone the project, then open index.html in any modern browser to start using the tools instantly. No setup required.

Deployment:
Upload index.html to the root of your GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages, or drag and drop the project folder to Netlify for instant hosting.
